# Face-Recognition-in-Keras-using-CNN
Face recognition system  is implemented in python 3.7 using keras and opencv. CNN model is used for prediction of the test image.

It contains three files:
Dataset.py:- to create dataset for 2 users
CNN.py :- for building the model 
test.py:- for testing the model

Initially camera is initialised and images for dataset is captured and stored in specified folder in jpg format.

Model is built for the above stored dataset and stored in model.h5 file.

Model is tested by initialsing the camera and capturing the test image.

Results is displayed on the  console and also on  the pop up window triggered by camera.
